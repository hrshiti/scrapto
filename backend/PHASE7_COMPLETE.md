## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables:
Ensure these are set in `backend/.env`:
```
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
```

### 2. Create Admin User:
**IMPORTANT:** Admin uses **password-based login** (NOT OTP-based login).

**Using Script (Recommended):**
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/createAdmin.js
```

Or with custom credentials:
```bash
node scripts/createAdmin.js admin@scrapto.com Admin@123 "Admin User" 9999999999
```

**Default credentials:**
- Email: `admin@scrapto.com`
- Password: `Admin@123`
- Name: `Admin User`
- Phone: `9999999999`

**Note:** Password will be automatically hashed by the User model's pre-save hook.

### 3. Admin Login:
**IMPORTANT:** Admin MUST use password-based login (not OTP-based login).

**Login Endpoint:**
```
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

Body:
{
  "email": "admin@scrapto.com",
  "password": "Admin@123"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "...",
      "name": "Admin User",
      "email": "admin@scrapto.com",
      "role": "admin",
      "isActive": true,
      ...
    },
    "token": "jwt_token_here"
  }
}
```

**After Login:**
- Use the returned `token` in Authorization header for all admin endpoints
- Format: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Admin should NOT use:**
- ❌ `POST /api/auth/login-otp` (OTP-based login - for users/scrappers only)
- ❌ `POST /api/auth/verify-otp` (OTP verification - for users/scrappers only)

### 4. Start Backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 5. Test Endpoints:
Use Postman or similar tool to test:
- Login as admin user to get JWT token
- Use token in Authorization header: `Bearer <token>`
- Test all admin endpoints

## 📝 Notes

1. **Admin User Creation:** Use the provided script `scripts/createAdmin.js` to create admin users. Admin uses password-based login (not OTP-based).

2. **Price Feed:** When creating a new price for a category and region, old active prices are automatically deactivated.

3. **Order Assignment:** Manual assignment validates:
   - Scrapper exists
   - Scrapper is active
   - Scrapper has verified KYC
   - Scrapper has active subscription

4. **Plan Deletion:** Cannot delete a plan if there are active subscriptions using it. Deactivate instead.

5. **User/Scrapper Deletion:** Cannot delete if they have existing orders. This prevents data integrity issues.

6. **Sensitive Data:** KYC documents (Aadhaar number, license number) are excluded from responses for security.

3. **Add admin registration endpoint** (optional - for initial setup)
4. **Add export functionality** (CSV/Excel exports for reports)
5. **Add more analytics** (user growth, order trends, etc.)
6. **Add audit logging** (track admin actions)
7. **Add admin activity logs** (who did what and when)
