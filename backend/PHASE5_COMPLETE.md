- ✅ Plan limits: maxPickups, priority
- ✅ Plan status: isActive, isPopular, sortOrder
- ✅ Static methods: `getActivePlans()`, `getActivePlanById()`

#### 6. **Updated PaymentController**
- ✅ Enhanced `verifySubscriptionPayment` to use subscription service
- ✅ Proper planId linking

- ✅ Basic Plan (₹99/month)
- ✅ Pro Plan (₹199/month)
- ✅ Quarterly Plan (₹249/3 months)

### Frontend:

#### 1. **Subscription API** (`modules/shared/utils/api.js`)
- ✅ `subscriptionAPI.getPlans()` - Get all plans
- ✅ `subscriptionAPI.getPlan(id)` - Get plan by ID

- ✅ `subscriptionAPI.subscribe(planId)` - Subscribe to plan
- ✅ `subscriptionAPI.verifyPayment(paymentData)` - Verify payment

- ✅ Shows current subscription if exists
- ✅ Dynamic plan display with all features
- ✅ Proper loading and error states
- ✅ Integrated with new subscription API

## 📋 API Endpoints

### Public/Scrapper Endpoints:
```
GET    /api/subscriptions/plans              - Get all active plans
GET    /api/subscriptions/plans/:id         - Get plan details
GET    /api/subscriptions/my-subscription   - Get my subscription (Protected)
POST   /api/subscriptions/subscribe          - Create subscription (Protected)

## 🔄 Subscription Flow

### New Subscription:
1. Scrapper selects plan from `/scrapper/subscription`
2. Frontend calls: `POST /api/subscriptions/subscribe` with `planId`
3. Backend creates Razorpay payment order
4. Frontend opens Razorpay checkout
5. User completes payment
6. Frontend calls: `POST /api/subscriptions/verify-payment`
7. Backend verifies payment and activates subscription
8. Frontend updates localStorage and redirects to dashboard

### Renewal:
1. Scrapper clicks "Renew Subscription"
2. Frontend calls: `POST /api/subscriptions/renew` with `planId`
3. Payment flow (same as new subscription)
4. Subscription extended from current expiry date

### Cancellation:
1. Scrapper clicks "Cancel Subscription"
2. Frontend calls: `POST /api/subscriptions/cancel` with optional reason
3. Backend marks subscription as cancelled
4. Subscription remains active until expiry
5. Auto-renewal disabled

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Backend Testing:
- [ ] Run seed script: `node backend/scripts/seedSubscriptionPlans.js`
- [ ] Test GET /api/subscriptions/plans (should return 4 plans)
- [ ] Test GET /api/subscriptions/plans/:id
- [ ] Test POST /api/subscriptions/subscribe (creates payment order)
- [ ] Test POST /api/subscriptions/verify-payment (activates subscription)
- [ ] Test GET /api/subscriptions/my-subscription (returns active subscription)
- [ ] Test POST /api/subscriptions/cancel
- [ ] Test POST /api/subscriptions/renew
- [ ] Test authorization (user can't access scrapper endpoints)

### Frontend Testing:
- [ ] Plans load from backend (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Plan selection works
- [ ] Payment flow works (Razorpay checkout)
- [ ] Subscription activates after payment
- [ ] localStorage updates correctly
- [ ] Redirect to dashboard works
- [ ] Current subscription displays if exists
- [ ] Error handling works
- [ ] Loading states work

### Integration Testing:
- [ ] End-to-end subscription flow
- [ ] Payment integration
- [ ] Dashboard access after subscription
- [ ] Order assignment (only active subscribers)
- [ ] Expiry handling

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Seed Subscription Plans:
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/seedSubscriptionPlans.js
```

This will create 4 default plans:
- Basic Plan (₹99/month)
- Pro Plan (₹199/month)
- Quarterly Plan (₹249/3 months)
- Yearly Plan (₹1999/year)

### 2. Environment Variables:
Ensure these are set in `backend/.env`:
```
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_key_secret
```

### 3. Start Backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 4. Start Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 📝 Notes

1. **Auto-renewal**: Currently manual renewal only. Auto-renewal can be added later with cron jobs.

2. **Expiry Handling**: Server checks expiry on every subscription fetch. Can add cron job for batch updates.

3. **Payment Integration**: Uses existing Razorpay integration from Phase 2.

4. **Backward Compatibility**: Old payment endpoints still work but new subscriptions should use subscription API.

5. **Subscription Status**: 
   - `active` - Subscription is active and not expired
   - `expired` - Subscription has expired
   - `cancelled` - Subscription was cancelled (but may still be active until expiry)

---

## ✅ Success Criteria Met

1. ✅ Scrappers can view available plans
2. ✅ Scrappers can subscribe to a plan
3. ✅ Payment integration works
4. ✅ Subscription activates after payment
5. ✅ Scrappers can view their subscription
6. ✅ Scrappers can cancel subscription
7. ✅ Scrappers can renew subscription
8. ✅ Expired subscriptions are handled
9. ✅ Dashboard access requires active subscription
10. ✅ Plans are fetched from backend (not hardcoded)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the complete flow** end-to-end
2. **Add subscription management UI** (cancel, renew buttons in profile)
3. **Add auto-renewal logic** (optional - cron job)
4. **Add expiry reminders** (optional - notifications)
5. **Add admin endpoints** for plan management (Phase 7)

**Status:** ✅ Phase 5 Complete - Ready for Testing & Confirmation

**Next Phase:** Testing & Bug Fixes → Phase 7 (Admin Panel) or Phase 6 (Notifications)
